See the Home Assistant developer documentation about:

 - Use [the Conversation API](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/intent_conversation_api) to send text commands to Home Assistant and receive responses.
 - [Register intent handlers](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/intent_handling) to add new intents to Home Assistant.
 - [Fire intents](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/intent_firing) if you have your own sentence matching logic and want Home Assistant to handle the intents.
